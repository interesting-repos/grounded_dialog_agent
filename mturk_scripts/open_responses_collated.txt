(test, 1)	Ugh. I can never figure out how to get it to understand that red and white container with the snap lid! It always goes for the soda can instead. Argh.  ^_^ Thank you very much for this task. It's a highlight of my day.
(test, 2)	A good day for Mr.Robot. It's nice to have progress. Thank you. ^^
(test, 3)	Wow. It's made some progress. It was a lot easier to parse this time. Thank you. ^^
(test, 0)	Neat to be using a different version, or at least that's how it seemed today. Thank you. ^^
(test, 1)	Whoo. That was nasty. I couldn't figure out even the first task. I've got to think how to phase things better. Thanks for the opportunity.
(test, 3)	Thank you. ^^
(test, 3)	The robot has gone soda crazy. Run for the hills. ^_^ Oh dear. Every answer ends in 'Orange Soda Can' today.  Thank you.

(train, 0)	Well, it’s evident that the robot has quite a bit of a learning-curve to trudge. But once it makes that journey, it could well compete for the title of man’s best friend. Doing this task sure made me think how much I take humans for granted. Thank you!
(test, 1)	Well, the first time around the cursor was stuck at the start of Task 3 and the robot was unresponsive. So, I had to restart and ended up doing 5 tasks in all. It was slightly frustrating, but fun all the same. Thank you!

(test, 3)	The robot somehow decided that I wanted to deliver something to SOMEONE instead of TO someplace and there was no way to fix that

(test, 1)	The last task I said yes when the robot asked if I wanted to deliver something to someone when I really wanted him to take something from one place to another. Sorry, I think it needs to be more clear what the robot is asking. Also, once I say &quot;no&quot; to an object, the robot shouldn't ask again and again about that same object unless it's about identifying features.
(test, 3)	OMG, once I say no to an object, the robot shouldn't ask again. He kept referring to the same object!!! UGH!!!
(test, 0)	Much better this time! Definitely improving!
(test, 3)	The robot kept asking about the same object (the coke can) when I said container, not can. When I say no to one object, the robot should not return to that object.

(test, 3)	It says the robot understands complex tasks, but does understand words like plastic or end or hallway.  It would take longer to tell the robot what to do, and have it systematically ask questions instead of actually understanding the inputs.  Siri is more useful.
(test, 3)	This robot does not understand commands, words, or really anything useful.  I don't understand the point of a robot that can't be redirected, or instructed simple words such as &quot;across the hallway&quot; or &quot;white bottle&quot;   Useless at the moment.
(test, 2)	I do not understand why the robot can't comprehend simple instructions or words.  It's completely useless in this format.  I'd have more luck training my 2 week old puppy to deliver the can of pringles.

I was not sure if that was and it was my first time trying to direct the robot, when in fact it did need to manipulate the item. I'd be willing to repeat my work but would very much appreciate not receiving a rejection as if it was a failed task. Please consider it. Thank you.

I realized this error after this mistake and corrected my instructions accordingly for the next 2 tasks (which were successful).

A3LM9JHGX8JWO0
(test, 2)	it would be good if you could respond with more than yes or no, so that you could teach the robot.  For example, if the answer is 'no', you can provide a 'use this instead' type of answer.

A3L459M9ME6WKI
(test, 1)	The final task asked the robot to move an empty can from a conference room to a pod and not someone's office. I think this further confused the robot.

A3KYEJPW3JVVVV
(train, 1)	No comments.

A3KVW46MTHGOZS
(test, 3_np)	There was a significant delay in typing response on the task screen, which made it more difficult to complete the task and caused some inaccuracies on my end (typos mainly). As far as the robot is concerned, it kept repeating questions, which led me to believe it wasn't learning very well. Further, it seemed to have limited information in its base programming (color, shape, etc) which made it difficult to describe things for it.

A3KOXHH84OKZ9G
(test, 1)	The robot doesn't seem to have any sense of direction and I found the conversation extremely frustrating.

A3JDA7VYL1W1DC
(test, 0)	Its pretty green and it took way too much time, i got 2 task wrong and i answered wrong too but i like that it learns, it need clear &quot;Stop&quot;, &quot;Clear&quot;, &quot;Restart&quot; commands so it becomes less frustrating and it should have &quot;Save&quot; commands that you can load previous successful attempts before they went wrong. If this item were to be on the market an official web were users can upload those saves would be needed.

A3EVXSWHYA1PTT
(test, 3_np)	Honestly, that was terrible. Shouldn't the robot be programed to know the offices of the people listed with their full names and titles? How does it know brown, yellow, blue, but not orange (I actually don't think it knows the color of objects but it's encountered those words before but not orange)? Why doesn't it know words that it used? Needs a lot more tweaking.

A3EM49IJLS9JT0
(test, 1)	It was very frustrating. I didn't know if you wanted me to phrase answers to the robot's questions in a full sentence.

A3EAUAU8V3B5S7
(test, 3)	I was awful at that! That was incredibly frustrating, though not entirely the robots fault.

A3DIRN48SZVNRE
(test, 0)	The robot didn't respond at all to what I was saying. At first when I was misspelling Dr. Smalt as &quot;Smart&quot; I understand it was my mistake. Even after I got the spelling right, the robot still didn't understand how to do a simple task even after I tried to explain it a dozen times.

A3D5BMOC6B7XNQ
(test, 0)	the rooms should have numbers, would be better. maybe a template of what the robot understands.

A3CRYPGY8OH1P1
(test, 3_np)	The first task was not well explained. The user should know the robots base vocabulary in order to train it.

A3CL3Q1FZZUMRH
(test, 3)	This robot had no understanding of anything I was describing.

A3CGF3CWKTCGGR
(test, 3_np)	Robot had trouble understanding the properties of objects and also couldn't understand that I wanted to deliver an object to a different person. Kind of frustrating and wished I could answer more than yes or no to certain questions.

A3C2PSZEKN8OWD
(test, 0)	GOOD

A3BJTYGNU3K82A
(test, 0)	Good

A3ACX99H78WTEK
(test, 2)	In the time spent teaching the robot, I could have delivered the coffee to Peggy Parker myself!

A3A9NHZWTB5EKH
(test, 0)	the robot doesnt understand major of the letters and words. no point wasting time behind such mechanism

A39ZYRK3XFFUBJ
(test, 2)	The task asking to help the robot navigate to a room on a map was worded such that I initially thought the robot was already located in that room. It took some time to understand the directions for that task.

A39GADIK8RLMVC
(test, 1)	The last task was far too frustrating and long.

A3811HP7ZXQOEE
(test, 3_np)	The robot did not understand my commands and it was not easy to know which commands the robot would understand.

A36PRTZFECB76C
(train, 0)	the poor robot isn't quite ready for production as yet.

A3696JXTRKL2FI
(test, 1)	The bot was not able to understand full sentences at all.

A366TZDVJK02PN
(test, 0)	This is always a fun task.

A360G5G0DVWU7X
(train, 2)	The robot didn't see to understand a lot of the directions that were given. It took a lot of work to get the robot to move in the right direction.

A35ZRGM4AQ6FF5
(train, 1)	N/A

A359Z1PUM7U6F0
(test, 2)	On the second task I finally said yes even though the robot had the wrong person (B not P) because it kept going in circles with questions and I just couldn't take it anymore.

A356W64SEGGSW1
(train, 0)	Thank you for the survey, it is fun.

A33M7EZ72P8TWF
(test, 2)	fun study

A32TKDOP38BLTM
(train, 0)	While it couldn't understand that i wanted it to get the jar of peppercorns, i think it's really good at understanding the basics of what i was saying. After its learned a lot more I'd say it would be very useful.

A32IRN8APZMCQ2
(test, 3)	Thank-you

A320QA9HJFUOZO
(test, 1)	Extremely frustrating. Way too long. Horribly underpaid.

A31YTICDM7ZMP6
(test, 3)	your robot is fucking stupid. the instructions said it understands high level commands - that is a lie.

A31C75PL4FJIO
(test, 3_np)	VERY INTERESTING OF TASK.

A317RA15E0SZ4P
(test, 0)	After the first task, the robot encountered some problem and I was asked t proceed to the survey. The first task was interesting and the fact that the robot understood my instructions with just high level instruction is quite good. I believe the robot already knows all the rooms and their relative positions without which it would have been difficult to accomplish the task.

A316NPK57UTIRF
(test, 3)	It was my mistake to gave a wrong order to the robot. It will be useful if I could cancel and do a re-order.

A30QJ6OLAICVI7
(test, 0)	It was frustrating trying to communicate with the robot.

A30J4IZCMCR31F
(test, 3)	The box wouldn't let me type about half of the time. This was very frustrating, it didn't understand basic things.

A309E9ZYRIL8X2
(test, 3)	There was no way to reset the robot if it went down the wrong path of logic, or if I misunderstood what it was saying.

A3023MDFGEIKKU
(test, 3_np)	Even though interacting with the robot was frustrating this was a fun experience.

A2ZNN99UEJA2EU
(train, 2)	This robot was obviously not ready for &quot;training&quot;, this survey was underpaid and I am personally offended at you all for wasting my time. I completed it literally only to be able to tell you this. Please consider higher payment for HITS like these, we are real people, NOT like your robot.

A2YJFCTJPPX66
(test, 3)	death to the robot, it has the brain of a turnip

A2XOP6WJGR59QR
(test, 3)	It just stopped responding after a while and sat around while (thinking). Was unable to do anything about it.

A2XFBUPU9EMQG2
(test, 0)	Robots are now becoming part of human life now in this world.

A2XEDQ8Z1AWUD4
(test, 3)	I think my attempts confused the robot, and from there I couldn't get back on track to the task, hard as I tried.  I don't think I'm very good at communicating with it.

A2X3O8OGDVDPD6
(test, 3)	It seems the robot AI didn't properly load, despite my waiting for several minutes.

A2WWKCWR04ZO1B
(test, 1)	NICE

A2VNBZ7P595W77
(train, 1)	nice experience and i had tried my level best to complete the task. i can't make the robot to change the object once selected. if we yes wrongly or unknowingly ,it is very difficult to reverse the selected option.

A2VK3O6PUGN370
(test, 2)	GOOD

A2VI55LKT5L4KB
(test, 0)	very interesting task I enjoyed doing this thanks

A2V8LLZRTOP79S
(test, 2)	Some task should quit complex.

A2UQ98FHANPPLW
(test, 3_np)	The robot didn't understand when I wanted to send an object to a room that didn't have a person in.

A2UODQ3AUFVCTZ
(test, 2)	It was frustrating trying to get the robot to understand, but I guess over time it would get easier. I was still glad to be a part of the experiement, It was cool talking to the robot.

A2UMB419R9QW8L
(train, 2)	nice task to even a chance to update myself too.

A2UKNS67YRI4NM
(test, 2)	very frustrating getting the robot to perform tasks

A2UF73T5FVZKMM
(test, 0)	NOTHING

A2TZKV4CB8K6XF
(test, 3)	I wish the robot could return to prior commands, I got hung up on the last task because he was determined to go somewhere.

A2TKHUHOPMSQYH
(test, 2)	Really cool idea. Just took forever to get it to even understand 1 thing.

A2TJ7OHN9V4ZI8
(test, 1)	Very, very awesome robot. This is going to be amazing for disabled people when it gets finished, thanks for letting us help!

A2SIJ1GKLZ37RD

A2QCHFSNUU7Y1F
(train, 0)	While I wouldn't care to use this particular robot to get or move items, I wouldn't mind using a robot I had more faith in. I found myself wishing I could teach it key words we needed to function instead of looping through the guessing game without learning anything.

A2ORPKVJKI0EIO
(test, 0)	This was an infuriating task. The robot doesn't understand most of the time.

A2LXPQS44US390
(test, 3_np)	frustrating task. Why have multiple locations with the same name [i.e. 'lab']. The task would be simple if I was able to positively identify exactly where to go without ambiguous terms like 'office'

A2LS3TW31IRA9U
(test, 3)	The robot task was somewhat difficult but became a bit easier to understand as I advanced through the tasks.

A2LJRJUH5XEPT9
(test, 2)	Interesting HIT, thanks!

A2LCOTUKCDULAA

A2K3MUBO2FWKRD
(train, 0)	The robot needs ALOT of work.

A2JQ7V9EWJ51T2
(train, 1)	I really enjoyed the robot but once it thought I wanted an item even though it was wrong I didn't know how to make it find the other item.

A2JHF7CU91EVXW
(test, 3)	that was fun!

A2IFMHXWL5GOWD
(test, 3_np)	Interesting survey that was pretty fun trying to think of ways to get the robot to understand.

A2HEP2U556AI0Y
(test, 0)	task ended early because robot encountered a problem.

A2GYBSWW22DPQG
(test, 0)	I think the robot needs to learn more words. I think the robot has to understand words like office, conference rooms, correct, sorry etc. I think it is a very interesting project. Good luck!

A2GTY8GLAYN9BU
(test, 2)	GOOD

A2FWJOSAHFW8P5
(train, 0)	The robot needs to have more knowledge of meanings of words. It was very confused.

A2FI77833XNV3T
(test, 3)	There was a problem with the robot that did not allow the task to preform

A2F79GFUWU5O96
(test, 0)	It was too hard to talk to the robot.

A2F2DDH12YU4AK
(test, 1)	No further comment, at this time.

A2ELYTGQYWVGBG
(test, 3)	The robot didn't understanding. It was very frustrating. He needs to know what the items are called and the people's names for this to be effective at all.

A2E8FEGQV8FHR0

A2E6G3YGPG97B6
(test, 3_np)	Very Nice task

A2E5PZUD6W4OA1

A2DSGT2WC9XV54
(train, 2)	This is a fun activity. I hope it helps!

A2CYD8QD1JO0O5
(train, 0)	the conversation box expanding was a bit annoying as it scrolled the page lower from my objectives and whatever item/person the robot was referring to.

A2CW38L6UOM77U
(test, 3)	It was fun! Thank you for the opportunity to take your survey!

A2BT0LQYMBL7LV
(test, 3_np)	It was unique experience.

A2BP8SSKYDZZ64
(train, 1)	It was really hard to start a task over if you didn't quite understand the robot the first time.

A2BBDH8DZD77AU
(test, 2)	Robot could not understand anything other than yes or no. Would not stop asking if I would describe an object as something completely unrelated to the object in the picture.

A2B153AHPWHLH1
(test, 3_np)	The webpage responded poorly.

A2AY6EZF3P3T6A
(train, 0)	I wasn't able to type anything into the box. It just froze for a few minutes and then said something about a technical issue and to move on to survey.

A2AWNIQ10EO1K
(test, 2)	Accidentally answer one of the questions wrong and the robot could not accept a separate task or allow me to take back what I said. Other than that, I thought the robot was pretty clever.

A2APVPVSZRKPEG
(test, 2)	I was just about to return the HIT before getting access to the survey button. Might want to have it show up a bit sooner.

A2ANXVI5UXQHGT
(test, 2)	For the last take I attempted to move the robot into the lounge where the pringles were. Then I was going to tell it to pick it up and move it to the correct office. I was only able to move the robot into the lounge and it assumed that the task was completely finished.

A2ANP4POGYTNWD
(train, 0)	I tried to get the robot to go to the room but failed. I tried to be as creative as possible with suggestions but still did not succeed, and this is why i would not use this robot. Maybe when he learns a bit more!

A2A2PCKG5Q3U2G
(test, 0)	I'm sure the robot could be useful and is definitely better than some primitive robots, but it was very difficult to communicate with. It wouldn't be as bad if the robot responded more quickly. But, it just didn't seem to understand more complex sentences, so that would be something to improve on as well.

A2A0MSLKF3ERF4
(test, 3_np)	INTERESTING INTERACTION TASK

A29TV2MF4893DA
(train, 0)	I wanted to be descriptive in what should be moved and where but my descriptions were not understood by the robot yet.  I wanted to say &quot;plastic lid&quot;, blue container, cylinder, etc.  These descriptions didn't work.

A2929S7JLLYFSW
(test, 2)	Robot is not at all working can't even understand the simple command

A27F76XB3KS0W2
(train, 2)	I've done one of these tasks previously. Both times, it was hard to tell the robot to go to one of the offices that doesn't belong to a particular person. Is there any way to give these offices names and teach them to the robot?

A277U3NSBWRQ2G
(test, 1)	Apparently it doesn't understand colors yet, because it constantly chose a yellow can even though I clearly stated I wanted a blue can.  Not sure outsourcing your training is a the greatest idea as people that don't care about the quality of the work will just click through anything to get to the end result in the shortest amount of time.

A26NGLGGFTATVN
(train, 2)	Interesting tests, thank you.

A25QYDN0FFJXPG
(train, 2)	The starting directions were unclear, but once I tried something it was more clear.  The most frustrating part is when I give an answer about a location and the follow up question is about an object.  This made me think I was wasting my time

A25EGRCD2LG0KK
(test, 2)	no

A258DUZQTRIEK0

(test, 0)	n/a

A20DA3UPHPQSST
(test, 3_np)	I had no way of knowing what to call the pills, and the robot couldn't find them. It might be helpful to give a set of item descriptions the robot might understand, also I had no idea how to tell him to go to the empty office next to David &quot;Dave&quot; Daniel room, and how to specifically describe the specific lab he needed to deliver the pills too. Overall, I found commanding the robot to be a bit confusing without a set of more concrete instructions.

A20CPK8PYD2V28
(test, 3)	there was an issue with the program and I was unable to connect with the robot. Not sure what happened. I was instructed to come here and submit for payment.

A204O2CH22KQR

A1Z6F6EIUJFC6T
(test, 1)	This is nice study

A1YIGXBU6FQQ6C
(test, 0)	Besides the robot lack of understanding being frustrating, I found annoying issues with the task on my navigator, like some pictures I did not see at first because they were misplaced and the need to retype letters on my keyboard too many times.

A1YE1SX5XE3SOG
(train, 0)	The interface needs to be simplified. I didn't even realize there were pictures of what the robot was suggesting it would move until the last trial because seeing them required me to scroll up to the top of the page.

A1XC5W5WFRCMD1
(test, 0)	The third task was not loading

A1X1IRFYQZ40LD
(test, 3)	The robot moved the item to offices around P peggy parker but did not move the item to her office.

A1WGAGT5ZN4A3X
(train, 2)	It seems that the robot is better than before

A1UCB0D27PY623
(test, 3)	I gave up using sentences when it failed to understand the meanings of words it was using.

A1T3ROSW2LC4FG
(train, 2)	frustratingly inaccurate.

A1SYINVMVM1AJA
(test, 1)	This task was extremely frustrating

A1SVMRA5E2S552
(test, 2)	The robot didn't understand basic colors. It was frustrating trying to get it to do the assigned tasks.

A1S9EY8YUIGDYV
(test, 1)	During the second task, the robot seemed to have gotten stuck in a chat loop about delivering to the wrong person. I wasn't able to relay the instructions as expected.

A1S8QSM1T86H8I
(test, 3)	What the heck was that last object? A styrofoam block?

A1RVMADIZE3BXK
(train, 2)	I do not think the last task was completed correctly.  It seems the robot went to its destination without taking the bottle of tylenol.

A1RH11VAT52YFH
(test, 3)	By the last question, I was just getting use to the actual language to command the robot. The questions that the robot asked back were perfect though, but the wrong items were selected... it was more my fault due to me not knowing the actual names of the items.

A1PFE8T2LNWFLV
(test, 3_np)	I liked this.

A1PE5GCMNEFIT4
(test, 1)	It was semi difficult to understand what the task was asking.

A1ND9FU7OO5NQA
(test, 2)	very good and interesting task to do, looking forward to more robotic tasks.

A1N4P4XGQM7NXE
(train, 0)	pretty awful overall

A1N1WY7UCRBQQ9
(test, 3)	The robot couldn't tell the difference between the &quot;yellow can&quot; and a &quot;soda can&quot;, with no clear way to correct it.  It also couldn't comprehend delivering items to a room not assigned to a person.  This resulted in the third task being unfinished.

A1N1EF0MIRSEZZ
(test, 0)	The survey is really long and the robot thinks sometimes slowly, so I think the pay is low in comparison.

A1MTRZDRKNB9GV
(test, 3)	I think this was really interesting, I really enjoyed this and see who it could work

A1MRBBA2OLM223
(test, 1)	The robot could not understand the last task where I was asking it to move something from an office to the lounge.

A1MDMWZH08R3TI
(test, 3_np)	The robot does not work well.  Interesting task.

A1KEM2M1XFP594
(test, 3)	Very frustrating. It needs some work knowing what things are. I had no idea what to tell it

A1JW11G1QUNMGN
(train, 1)	Too many unnecessary questions

A1JRP3B1LNXJRP
(test, 3)	The instructions were kind of vague. I wasn't clear on how to give exact commands.

A1JP9WQD22FUJN
(test, 2)	Apparently, robots and I don't communicate well :)

A1JN5U8GXPURYU
(test, 0)	I had some difficulty telling the robot to move from Office to Office.  I couldn't simply type Office N.  It wouldn't recognize that.  This made it difficult to navigate.

A1JFQYGO8M6EWX

A1HSGWFVXK2MYZ
(test, 0)	It wasn't understanding basic words.

A1HKCTDOTL6C9I
(test, 2)	The first two task took some time but the final one was difficult. There was no marking that the robot could understand on the placement of the can for the robot so I could not get the robot to understand where to place or deliver the item.

A19KF02ULCISTQ
(train, 1)	Organization of the task is bad. Better, &quot;The robot is at the X. On the right will be the objects for this task. The robot will ask yes or no questions to be answered by you&quot;.

(train, 2)	none

A18J7H2QA7UQIR
(train, 0)	it's good.

A175PJR0W3LO8I
(train, 0)	it's a very unintuitive robot that has poor memory and learning skills!

A16SJ5D3DKUEXJ
(test, 3)	Without a clear way to start at the beginning with the robot, it was very frustrating to get anywhere with it.  I don't know how else I could've described the objects to get the robot to select the right thing.

A16SAB417Y96G4
(test, 0)	Why does the robot have to ask the same question so many times?

A16LZUEQ6JGHWA
(train, 0)	This was extremely interesting to participate in. Thank you for this opportunity.

A16G6PPH1INQL8
(test, 3_np)	I got the robot to every objective except the last one. I finally gave up because the robot would only understand to deliver the object to a person, not a pod.  It was frustrating.  I did try and I did get the robot to find the object at least.

A15YUZ5RUNA6FI

A14X9MMC9P7XI8
(test, 3)	The tasks are easy for me to understand, and it states to give all of my step-by-step instructions at one time, but the robot never understood more than the first step in my instructions every single time.

A143J3H0S644SM
(test, 3_np)	As AI's go, this one feels about as rudimentary as it gets, so if felt a bit frustrating but  glad I had a chance to work on this one - hope it was a help. Good luck with your research, thx!

A13V13Y2DJGFT4
(train, 0)	its good

A13STUE0VL42FA
(test, 2)	Good survey thanks

A13B56UPRDS9HH
(test, 0)	The very first task was almost right. The next two not so much.

A12L49XOTAS4H8
(test, 2)	none

A11TCJMOZD2JMK
(test, 3)	Either there needs to be a specific syntax/format for the questions to be asked, or the &quot;robot&quot; needs a more sophisticated understanding of language.

A11CMD4XAPS2Y4
(test, 2)	the first task was not hard but the other two were frustrating

A10VV1SPM63I94
(test, 3_np)	Seems like the robot doesn't understand basic commands, but instead tries to randomly ask for things to do or places to go. Interesting topic but this robot definitely needs a major upgrade. :)
