5c1c1814796e8: funny

5c1c7868b24d1: Good

5c1c0514077da: no problems, thank you.

5c1c5ddb53531: Arg! Would have been easy if I hadn't made typos

5c1c0154c0c57: n/a

5c1c47b315019: That was really annoying and underpaid.

5c1c0ea39e4d1: I might have struggled a bit with giving higher-level commands but I think I still managed to experience some difficulty where I had to define the objects/area. The choices definitely helped!

5c1c22ef50ffa: no

5c1c103f66ab2: The map showed that the object was supposed to be delivered next to one of the identified people's office. So it was confusing as to where the object was supposed to be delivered. The person to where the object is to be delivered should be clearly defined, not vague.

5c1c025a8f88c: The conversation created is really creative.

5c1c01a821293: I started out with a blip regarding what to do and corrected my sentence afterwards.

5c1c03f3f1570: The robot is getting smarter! It started to understand locations when I pointed them out.

5c1c0ab604130: The menu to select which human to pick dissipated before I could click it.

5c1c1729375ab: It was a pretty interesting task to take part in.

5c1c2afe515e3: Great experince. The poor robot ended up looking for a “wet” item, even though that was inside the container. It didn’t understand enough to learn what wet was. It needs to ask more questions so it can learn.

5c1c0e9db7b4f: Thanks. It was a little bit of a learning challenge to figure out how to best communicate with the robot but I feel that with enough practice I could be more effect with this task.

5c1d7d3482ff5: The robot was &quot;thinking&quot; during the entire process.  I was unable to complete any part of this task other than clicking on the link to open it.

5c1d7d799010f: Nothing happened the survey ended and it took me here.

5c1d7eb55ad30: Was the robot supposed to be told to pick up the object or did it already have it?

5c1d8b2e424b6: SO GOOD

5c1dad31a8b5d: The robot understood me pretty well and it was my fault for not giving them clearer instructions initially.

5c1d7e8609718: This was very fun!

5c1d7d8722ff6: The robot had issues and would not load so it advanced me to this survey.

5c1dbee6bea5d: Thanks!

5c1d7e75b5c17: We accomplishednothing.

5c1d7f6f2d673: It would have taken me a lot less time to move the item myself.

5c1d7f08bc4d5: thank you.

5c1d7f387c8bd: Robot did not understand that I wanted it to deliver the can to the pod. It only gave me choices of different people, I was not able to tell it that it was wrong.

5c1d7d3645d82: Did not get to interact with robot, but would have liked to - very much. Maybe another time? Maybe in a future hit? Count me in.

5c1d7de244a2c: As I always say, God gave me little patience and I´ve used most of it on my son.

5c1d7d8e7cea4: It said the robot was having problems or somehting like that and told me to go ahead and do survey. I hope I didnt do anything wrong

5c1d7df60783d: I don't know why it asked questions on objects just to be commanded to the conference room. This can be useful but needs more an understanding of things

5c1d9a3536ee5: THE ROBOT WAS VERY HARD TO COMMUNICATE WITH BUT THIS WAS FUN

5c1d7fd4dc5e3: I thought that this was a really fun experiment!

5c1d7e9092559: The robot requires significant improvements in artificial intelligence and machine learning programming in order to understand human language.

5c1d7dce355ca: The robot didn't work, I'd rather just have this oend forever then be rejected,but maybe there is a deadline to make a decish.

5c1d81fd05927: I'd have to &quot;get to know&quot; the robot before I use it.  That would make it easier!   That was fun!

5c1d7f06527bd: Good luck with your study.

5c1ed6fb32cbd: It was a good survey. The robot understood me.

5c1edf12081ee: I don't understand the metallic and beans business. Where did all of that come from?

5c1ed7c45893d: I enjoyed interacting with the robot

5c1ed828880ad: It was hard to see exactly what the object was which made this a lot more difficult than it needed to be in my opinion.

5c1ed923504ea: The task got stuck and asked me to choose from a menu - there wasn't a menu

5c1ed9174a425: The robot bamboozled me into giving up on Pringles and settling for peaches.

5c1ef78de12bf: There was no clear goal provided to me to give to the robot, so I made one up. It asked numerous questions that hint to me that it's in learning mode, not task completion mode. This process was frustrating since I was thinking in task completion mode. My expectations led to frustration. Overall, the robot responses were fine and good had I gone in thinking about the task a bit differently.

5c1ed86991fb2: that was just awful

5c1eda50bad3f: It would be much easier for me to just carry the object to the other office.

5c1ed95fc8eb2: The robot did not understand the names (long or short) or room designations (such as &quot;pod&quot; or &quot;office&quot;) that were clearly labeled in or alongside the map.

5c1edce17808b: This is so cool! I understand why there isn't one, but I think it would be extremely helpful to have some sort of list of words that the robot absolutely doesn't understand so people do not get him off topic and confused. Otherwise, this is fantastic! Hope I get to do another one!

5c1ee4d1056f5: I kind of had low expectations of the robot's natural language ability, but they weren't met. It's probably a good thing you didn't specify &quot;take a think to a person&quot; because then I wouldn't have known the robot doesn't know anything else. It is a kind of course of comedy, though, doubly so if the robot had suddenly shown up to give a block of styrofoam to the intern.

5c1ef3b434937: This was very fun . I love robots , thanks .

5c1ef7b2ebf2c: He doesn’t understand much conversation.

5c1ed6de27df3: The robot didn't get the object correctly and took a while to finally get it to the right destination.

5c1ee865a2456: Interesting experience.

5c1ed8ab8cab1: i did not understand what i needed to accomplish with the robot

5c1ef9a7d1689: Interesting and I would not mind doing it again as I enjoy these kinds of tasks.  I attempted to use language I thought the &quot;robot&quot; would understand, but apparently, it did not.  Perhaps a listing of terms the bot understands would be helpful or if you are trying to build it language understanding then this is fine the way it is.  Happy Holidays and I wish all of you the best in the coming year!

5c1ef34c4f88f: Confusing

5c1ef752d724c: Chat box for robot was very slow to type in

5c1efe6679927: GOOD SURVEY

5c1f322233b51: It was a bit confusing as to the task even after reading the instructions and even when it came to finding the &quot;similar&quot; items related to the words the robot ask about. I believe I did it right but again it was a bit confusing.

5c1f3605cfd5c: Interesting task

5c1f39d867a99: talking to the robot felt like i was talking to a kid learning new things

5c1f331bd4a45: Interesting project. Will look for more in the future! Thanks.

5c1f3daf1e088: the map did not show thats why i didnt know where to direct the robot

5c1f3ce53f529: The menu to choose where the robot needed to take the item appeared and then disappeared before I could use it, and never came back; I was then given a message that the robot had a problem and I could skip to the survey, so the task was not completed. The robot did not frustrate me, I frustrated myself.

5c1f315fc6339: I tried to tell it to go to the R symbol, using their name, think it was Richard Rogue. It didn't understand so I used office instead, but there was a lot of offices. Eventually, a map popped up and I just chose it for it.

5c1f349659ba9: There was no goal of where to go

5c1f2db36a9fb: I wasn't completely sure what my task was. The task said &quot;the robot should be at the position of the red x&quot;, and nothing else, so I asked to robot to go to that location; but I wasn't sure that was my objective. Maybe that was the robot's starting position and the task was just not printed?

5c1f2f3a5828d: It may of helped if there were a better example of how to speak to the robot.

5c1f2d866a5cd: GOOD

5c1f357338604: The robot continues to improve!

5c1f2def70e03: it was a nice experience

5c201e34aa8ed: i MADE A COMMENT ABOUT MOVING WHEN I MISREAD THE QUESTION. hOPE THAT IS NOT HELD AGAINST ME . i GOT THE IDEA AFTER THAT. sOEWHOW THE OBJECT WAS MOVED TO THE RIGHT OFFICVE BEFORE I COMPLETED THE QUESTIINING STRANGLELY

5c2045078026c: I'm sorry, I am a little nearsighted and misread the P as a B and thought it was for Bob initially. My apologies!

5c201cd8470ce: Too many overly simplistic answers given that didn't help the robot.

5c2053f090ad0: Is this the &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; that Elon Musk is so scared of?

5c20329b60ae6: No comment

5c201cbdc06f5: Robot figured it out fast!

5c2034de35707: The robot did not seem to understand that I just wanted him to go to the office the person was in, he did not necessarily need to interact with them specifically, but the robot wanted to bring them something so I picked an object.

5c20478660e22: nice

5c2032c4b50ed: it was fun

5c2026366db6c: I did not know the location of the robot to better be able to instruct it.

5c203c17950c9: I enjoyed taking this survey. Now after having done this one i feel i have a better understanding of how to go about instructing the robot. I would like to do more tasks like this.

5c20256f16b7c: I appreciate the offer.

5c20216414139: This is pretty cool. I think that it will take some time to teach robots to understand humans better or humans to learn how to communicate with robots better. All things considered it was fun and challenging to get the robot to understand me.

5c202290a3373: a little hard

5c201ec0ab418: It was interesting.

5c203ced79dc6: I thought I could write a sentences with more commands. Like take can and move it to here. But it was more one command per sentence. take can.
