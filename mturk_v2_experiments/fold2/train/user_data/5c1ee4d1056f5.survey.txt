I kind of had low expectations of the robot's natural language ability, but they weren't met. It's probably a good thing you didn't specify &quot;take a think to a person&quot; because then I wouldn't have known the robot doesn't know anything else. It is a kind of course of comedy, though, doubly so if the robot had suddenly shown up to give a block of styrofoam to the intern.
