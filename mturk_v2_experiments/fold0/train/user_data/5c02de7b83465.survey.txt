I didn't understand how to select the image of the object in question from the selection and accidentally chose the wrong one.  (And I couldn't undo it when I figured it out.)  I couldn't type anything in the last text box either.  The program prevented me from entering anything.  This was interesting, but I tell you, if I had a robot that was this &quot;stupid,&quot; I'd send it back to the factory. One interaction like this with a robot is enough for me. Thanks for posting this online. Good luck with your research!
