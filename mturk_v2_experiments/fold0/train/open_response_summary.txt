5bfe04501aae2: the instructions were clear and easy to follow.

5bfe02c9ace6a: It felt like we were starting from scratch in the training process for the bot which I guess is part of the purpose of this survey. I did not expect color and some basics of language to be initial blind spots for the AI.

5bfdfe6534ef8: This was a very fun survey.

5bfe00b7888fc: Very nice study! Keep up the good work!

5bfdfff32a344: It needs to start asking about nouns way earlier if the goal isn't to make people scream.

5bfdff39d3a0e: I am considerably less worried about AI taking over the world than I was a few minutes ago.

5bfe0a519ca5a: No comments at the current time.

5bfdfe1be753d: It wasn't clear in the directions if the robot needed to bring the object in another room to the room that was highlighted on the map. After going to the room with the object, the task was done.

5bfdfdc9d2463: The concept was overwhelming at first glance but came pretty clear after taking time to read and study the layout. The robot had trouble understanding some words but compared my words to others to get an idea what I was asking. Eventually it did what I told. Overall I thought it was a fun and interesting study.

5bfe0c30f1a91: n/a

5bfe667cc7b0d: The robot was a little annoying, but survey was OK. Thank you!

5bff0cff09807: Where was the robot supposed to go? I thought it was at the red x but there was no goal listed that I could find. What the heck were those pringles, beans questions? Really strange, had no idea what I was trying to do.

5bff066c967f0: Interesting task. It would have been easier if I knew the robot's limitations, specifically, it's vocabulary.

5bff17db8917b: Thanks for the opportunity to participate!

5bfef910a304a: Wasn't sure what the task was about??

5bfef8815892a: he was supposed to go to S for some TEA.

5bff37061a2ce: n/a

5bff3385d1251: I didn't understand where I had to get the robot!

5bff32edc858d: n/a

5bfefd9160e61: I feel the robot's vocabulary and object identification strategy should be improved.

5bff14f617b77: I was confused as to what to do

5bff3d966ce59: It was a bit frustrating trying to navigate it until I gave it something simple. this was a pretty good none the less.

5bff17172a05d: This was a fun survey. It was challenging to try to make the robot understand what it was supposed to do.

5bff10af44b45: Thanks so much.

5bff0a6c3ea37: I should have said Office M instead of the generic office.

5bff3542149ff: No thanks.
