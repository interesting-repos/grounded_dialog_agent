5c3946debf2f4: I asked the robot to go to office S, thinking that I was supposed to use the letters in the command, to simplify it for the robot. It was confused when I said, &quot;Go to office S.&quot; Once I typed, &quot;Dr. Sybil Smalt's office.&quot; in response to the robot's question of, &quot;Where do you want me to go?&quot; the robot immediately understood, and went there.

5c3953d54cc14: IS GOOD

5c39445950e08: none

5c39476683087: It was interesting.

5c39460275194: none

5c3944818c493: I think I had the most trouble with trying to describe the object which at the time was a soda can.

5c3944ced9853: Please rewrite your directions / HIT description; the actual goal of this HIT was extremely hard to understand through the instructions and description you gave.

5c3944bd24194: n/a, Thanks

5c3945d53b761: Very interesting! It was both frustrating and enjoyable at the same time.

5c3960d733e0f: There was no option to indicate and correct a typographical error. I accidentally typed &quot;c&quot; instead of &quot;can&quot; and couldn't correct my error easily.

5c396127bf61e: It was an interesting experience. I realize that it might have been easier if I used a simple command like Give A to B, instead of you should give A to B. The robot was confused for a bit due to &quot;you&quot; &amp; &quot;should&quot;

5c3944ea22f3d: n/a

5c39618c730e0: none

5c394535365ac: I was definitely making it more difficult than it needed to be.

5c39690f14daf: This was fun!

5c3947693084d: Directions unclear

5c396389a340d: Well the robot had a limited vocabulary. It would have been better to provide the vocabulary. Otherwise, it was just frustrating. At times, it went into an infinite loop.

5c395e2dd7064: My response is not good but please don't give up. I am lazy and I would like to have a robot like this to do things for me in the future

5c396a2d0836a: The description did not say where i should want the robot to go so I had the same problem the robot likely had.  I interpreted it as send the robot to a person, and they were all in offices so I told it to go to an office.  its navigation system seemed to work alright by selecting an office

5c39855cbd08a: It think it was pretty cool. I'd like to develop more with this robot

5c3945b8228a3: I was told to select an option from the menu/map but the menu/map never showed up.... I tried clicking around on the page and moving about to find it or maybe trigger it into showing up until I got the error message that the robot messed up and I could advance to payment. I was enjoying my conversation with it (the robot) though, and I think it would have understood me eventually; I would love to do a task like this in the future.

5c394941888db: This was interesting, thanks

5c39470066f96: It was pretty much roundabout questions from the robot. I started with, “Go to the conference room.” It kept asking the same questions, even though I “dumbed it down” to simple commands and “yes” answers. It didn’t get very far, to say the least.

5c3944c6f2749: Very tedious. Reminds me of programming stick figures in the old days. :) or playing old video games where you told the computer every step like &quot;look left&quot; &quot;go right&quot; etc. Even worse, instructions at the very beginner level.

5c394963469c4: This totally reminded me of programming my Omnibot and Big Trax toy bots as a kid in the 80's.  Good luck in your endeavors, and enjoy the good parts of your day.

5c3cff270ac48: This robot seemed to understand a variety of shapes and sizes. I really like that. Thank you very much for this cool project.

5c3cf73ba04f2: I inadvertently told the robot to deliver the wrong item. Frustrating, because I was on a roll getting it to understand me.

5c3d133437b38: I didn't understand what I needed to do which of course made it hard for the robot.  It took me reading everything several times to really get the idea of what needed to be done.

5c3d2ba9b4ea5: The explanation of the task was not very clear, had to learn from experience interacting with robot to figure out how I should interact.

5c3d30d464fe1: THe robot did not understand basic descriptions of common objects.

5c3d1df9f3ba0: great study

5c3d146626bb1: Interesting task. Reminded me of old Infocom text adventures like Zork. But interpeter seems more limited.

5c3cfc7cb6edc: Very cool! Thanks!

5c3cfb6048d03: I guess it works, but it was not obvious what to call the object.

5c3d26662436c: It asked about attributes of the object, rather than the object as a noun

5c3d07a87600a: Interesting experience - raised questions about how clear I am in giving commands

5c3d0e6e8381d: needs more experience in handling the robot

5c3d0783eeb00: It was confusing at first but I enjoyed this task! It was fun to do.

5c3cfcd429f58: none

5c3d324024027: This was certainly an interesting experience.

5c3cfa7aa2e0e: n/a

5c3d2f4304b1e: I couldn't really tell what the object was until I opened the picture in another window and enlarged it; then I could see that it was a plastic bottle of cold remedy pills. When I went back to the survey to enter that info, I couldn't do so. I think if I had asked the robot to give the bottle of cold remedy pills to Brown, perhaps I would have received a different response.

5c3e97c875dde: This task was a bit challenging!

5c3eb9885b788: I don't feel like the instructions were clear.

5c3ed1770c8a2: Good

5c3eb38534d12: Thank you

5c3e9e94d2dde: Having photos to choose the intended object from simplified things greatly and should have been offered from the start! Also it didn’t really make sense to have names labeled with letters unless those choices were going to be given to the robot - kind of unclear! Thanks

5c3e9654e79b4: This was interesting. I wish I had more time to work with the robot. Towards the end I was starting to have a lot of fun.

5c3e966d0481f: Very confusing set off rules

5c3e9736a9c86: thank you

5c3e985e1c0dd: Slightly frustrating, but still interesting task.

5c3e980798f4b: I did not communicate well with the robot. I told it to move the object on x in the pink map to the x on the green map and I confused the robot. I was not sure how to command it.

5c3e970582426: This was a lot of fun. I am sad that it can only be done once.

5c3ec38c12480: I did not see the robot move

5c3e97f0e3208: Yikes. The robot couldn't understand me. I would need a lot of practice to use one in real life.

5c3e98fe2a7b6: I would not use the robot until it understands more things.

5c3e971ad3006: Robot needs improve to understand commands better, like right, left

5c3e9653cc6e5: Could not get the robot to go to the office AND take the Pringles can. I only got the robot to go to the office with the can in it.

5c3e968302603: I was unaware that there were multiple objects the robot could select from. Had I known this I could have worded my first question better.

5c3e97e367ef4: The instruction for using the robot could have been more clear. For example, only giving yes and no questions. And the interface could be more user friendly, less clunky

5c40f7ae49331: The task was not easy but it was fun, I laughed a lot.

5c41042920f17: Thank you!

5c40df39dddb8: no comments

5c412f208faf2: I was unaware of the illistration option until  towards the end. I was under the impression that i had to verbally describe which room I wanted the bot to navigate to. Other than that, this study was very unique &amp; interesting, and I genuinely enjoyed participating in it.

5c40eb40e5863: I thought I would have another chance to get the object to its intended location. I intended to complete the task in steps.

5c40dbf2c5b76: thank you

5c40f08b9efed: It was hard to know what words were and weren't part of the robot's vocabulary, and whether or not we could give the instructions in multiple directives after the initial one.  The robot didn't understand the word &quot;piece&quot;.

5c40f98a35264: No comments, thanks.

5c40f7d8f3866: The robot knows words like &quot;I&quot;, but doesn't understand &quot;you&quot;.  That is strange.

5c40fb68205b7: I think that I was more at fault than the robot.

5c40e18b69d87: I guess we take for granted the supposed simplicity of the English language. I also feel that maybe that I did not understand the instructions correctly. When asked if the color gray was like the color yellow (blue, etc.), did the question mean was gray a &quot;color&quot; like yellow?

5c40ed9dc07b7: I was told to have the robot take the item to a room labeled pod, with no person indicated in that room.  My only option at the end was to select a person for the robot to deliver it to, so I chose the person in the closest office.

5c40f0d3e42d0: When it asked where I would like it to go, I had to retype out the entire phrase (Go to... versus just stating the name of the location); however, I liked that it confirmed the request instead of doing something that may be incorrect.

5c40d7020989e: It was too hard to find the right words. The robot should be able to understand more words

5c54e8e1a8548: It is just a matter of my getting used the to the type of command that the robot understands. The robot &quot;thinks&quot; differently, analyzes the situation in different steps  than myself obviously

5c5503f337561: This was fun

5c55065ce843b: I'd love a 2nd shot at this.  It was a challenge, but could be fun.  Clearly I failed to succeed in the task as I got the robot to go to Office P, but then the task ended.  I was assuming I could give the robot more commands once it got to the office.

5c54e97d9ae9f: I failed.

5c54edd945db0: All good

5c550844e9f65: Perhaps it was partly my fault, but I felt that I gave clear directions as to what to do.

5c54f683cdbcb: This was fun! Thank you!

5c552eeb19560: In this study is nice

5c5530e7d2b3d: VERY NICE

5c54ee9f079b6: The Robot didn't know what the word please meant and that's sad. :(

5c54edd8e35dd: Label all the rooms!

5c54eabd3609c: robot didnt work

5c54eec3367a0: No comment

5c54eed5582c1: This reminded me of 20 questions.

5c54e920ab580: The instructions weren't fully clear on what was needed. I tried to make it go step by step when apparently it was easier to just make it one instead.  I'm not 100% sure how you would be able to make it more clear as you advised to make it one complete sentence. It's possible I just was over-thinking it.

5c54f38067061: The robot needs a more expansive vocabulary to be able to function easily with human interaction

5c54f6c765453: nice survey

5c54f9d5237ab: felt like a test in how frustrated someone can get

5c5505986647f: I could not even select the office I wanted as a target so the robot moved the pringles container to the incorrect office.

5c54ebdd6c53b: I was not able to give the robot any instructions, it was stuck on &quot;thinking&quot; during the task.

5c54e9dde6950: i was unable to type anything... if you wish to hold my payment please feel free to do so because your survey was not working properly

5c54fa0c729be: The robot didn't seem to understand where to move things from one area to the next. I made a mistake and tried correcting it but it was hard for the robot to understand and then try and re understand what I was saying.

5c54eaa674f29: Waited for about five minutes to make sure it wasn't just taking it's time, but nothing ever happened. Just marked neutral for everything on the survey. Was looking forward to trying it.
