I was told to select an option from the menu/map but the menu/map never showed up.... I tried clicking around on the page and moving about to find it or maybe trigger it into showing up until I got the error message that the robot messed up and I could advance to payment. I was enjoying my conversation with it (the robot) though, and I think it would have understood me eventually; I would love to do a task like this in the future.
