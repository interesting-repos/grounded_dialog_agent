I couldn't really tell what the object was until I opened the picture in another window and enlarged it; then I could see that it was a plastic bottle of cold remedy pills. When I went back to the survey to enter that info, I couldn't do so. I think if I had asked the robot to give the bottle of cold remedy pills to Brown, perhaps I would have received a different response.
