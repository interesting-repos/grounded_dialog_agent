I asked the robot to go to office S, thinking that I was supposed to use the letters in the command, to simplify it for the robot. It was confused when I said, &quot;Go to office S.&quot; Once I typed, &quot;Dr. Sybil Smalt's office.&quot; in response to the robot's question of, &quot;Where do you want me to go?&quot; the robot immediately understood, and went there.
