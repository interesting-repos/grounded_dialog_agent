I'd love a 2nd shot at this.  It was a challenge, but could be fun.  Clearly I failed to succeed in the task as I got the robot to go to Office P, but then the task ended.  I was assuming I could give the robot more commands once it got to the office.
One thing of note, quite often the words I typed into the command box were missing letters.  This might be an issue with the program interface, and I know I was typing the letters.  It's not a big deal and it did force me to pay attention to what I was typing.
