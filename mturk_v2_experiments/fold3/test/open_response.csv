5c3803ab89433: good

5c37e9166b77e: none

5c3807bc51ab2: nice

5c37e54882279: The survey said the robot was having issues and recommended I advance to the end to conclude the session.

5c383347dbadf: good experience

5c38013e041a9: good

5c37e6c0786a4: It didn't work, the robot didn't say or do anything.

5c3831f36fe94: good

5c37f6f35dfa6: thanks

5c37ffd0b5043: You should have put the robot on the map also. I didn't know how to start.

5c38071d656dc: Bad robot

5c37e6040ca79: Wish it would have worked. The command I would have given was: Pick up the object in the kitchen and take it to Dr. Heidi Hughes office.

5c382cd9e0827: NICE

5c380548bacc9: Typing in this senario was extremely frustrating as there was a definite lag.  Hopefully that would not be the case if this were to be a real communication program.

5c3828344d452: The robot had a problem and I was told to advance to the next page. I'm interested in actually doing the task though!

5c37e8df48b88: The robot did not work

5c37e55b56709: The robot malfunctioned and did not take my questions at all.

5c382b071c926: GOOD

5c380c20d437a: The task was extremely slow and kept freezing. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that way or not, and it was definitely not my computer because everything else worked fine.

5c37e70a5efa2: I did not understand what I was supposed to do (the instructions didn't make much sense to me), however I was also not able to type anything out since there seemed to be a technical issue on the page so I couldn't even attempt what I thought the instructions might have meant.

5c37e6017a00a: there was an error and the robot did not ask me anything. i was advised to advance to the following screen

5c37e41f1a7cf: It told me that the robot was having problems and redirected me to the end of the survey.  I was looking forward to doing this task with the robot, so I'm a bit disappointed but thanks for the opportunity!

5c37ed7c1b426: I got NO response from the robot. I was unable to type an order to give to the robot. This disappointing because I was curious to see what the study entailed.

5c37eec27e3bd: my robot didn't work

5c37f3dbd393b: Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your survey!

5c37f8cb83987: Noticed that the interface menu (where you talk to the robot) was VERY sluggish to load and allow typing. Unlikely this is a computer issue as im using an updated version of chrome, AMD Threadripper 1950X 16 core processor, 8 GB ram and multiple AMD VEGA Frontier GPUs. I suspect you would get less frustration if the interface were faster and didnt cause more aggravations due to having to wait so long before you could type a response. Im afraid the frustration with the interface is compounded with the robot

5c37e8ffcc1ea: good study

5c37e740d8d78: n/a

5c37f54712274: I'm still not certain why the robot was not able to go to the office named after Dave the first time I typed it in, but then chose to ask about it later after answering a question about the hallway. *shrug* Maybe I treated it too much like a robot? Like it forgot that I had asked him to go the office in the first place. I don't know.

5c3861d9798fb: The robot never responded. Just sat at &quot;thinking....&quot; until the button allowing me to proceed to the end of the task appeared.

5c3a81d5e1e33: Not sure I understood what I was supposed to do with the robot, but was able to command it.

5c3ac76eb88c6: Confusing at first, but eventually you get the hang of the robot!

5c3a7a1dc9a86: I misspelled Person at the beginning, so sorry about that.

5c3a7ebe91204: The robot could not understand what I wanted it to give the person. I felt like I couldn't properly describe the object.

5c3a7b893d4b8: No comments.

5c3a7d6e3a043: Thank you

5c3a9cbf90273: The robot understood very little of what I was saying. However, it was helpful that the robot would bring up location maps and the pictures so I could choose what I meant.

5c3aa52eeb965: I feel like I'd have to have more interactions with a robot like this before making an informed decision about how I'd feel about working with it.

5c3ac03ca318b: too difficult to explain

5c3a7b8cc904f: no comments.

5c3a7a3eaf4f3: Although it was frustrating, I'm sure that as I learned to use the proper words to direct the Robot, it would probably get easier.

5c3a8cf6658c0: I feel like I was getting closer to understanding how the robot needed to hear my directions but it was definitely a bit frustrating.

5c3a7e1ecaf28: Found it very difficult to move the robot around...Guess we don't need to worry about skynet for awhile.

5c3a7b05961e5: none

5c3a7ae2a3d0a: I was probably confusing the robot as I tried to give it way too many instructions at first.  I was more confused than the robot!  We got it done though!

5c3a7a44ab8ad: no comments

5c3a7bd3744f1: I think the robot, when confused, lacks certain amount of politeness. Just my personal view, of course.

5c3a7dfab2098: Really cool experience

5c3ab1e5a7385: Very interesting. I'm curious what will be done with this.

5c3d6f52d31e2: I admit I didn't understand the object or where the robot was located and I made an assumption about the object when I selected where on the floorplan to move the robot.  In its current state, I would not use the robot as it seems to have a lot of learning to do about translating human commands to movement but if that is worked out, I don't think I would have any problem using this robot to complete tasks for me like grabbing a printout from the printer across the office or delivering a note to a coworker

5c3d71c57b925: There were no difficulties with the survey, technical or otherwise.  Well done. Thanks!

5c3d6f4c33750: Very frustrating to chat with the robot, but an interesting experience. I am interested in seeing the results of this study.

5c3d7235db0eb: This was an extraordinarily frustrating and unclear task.

5c3d96432c382: Thanks

5c3d6fd8599bd: I found this enjoyable and was able to get a little insight on question / response type interactions I may not have been fully aware of before. Thank you.

5c3d90b145b59: Might be less frustrating with some guidelines for what the robot is expecting to hear/syntax

5c3d711386a43: Need more clarification on this hit. I can only assume the robot never understood the actual object as it showed a paint can rather than the rectangular object. We need to know what the does and does not understand.

5c3d78bd7f4ab: I like this survey.

5c3d7135760c4: In the beginning my expectations went into the toilet when the robot started asking its first questions, but then it quickly recovered and learned what I wanted.

5c3d743bba608: The robot was fine, the tasks were lagging and making it difficult to type and choose the person in the program

5c3d72c26bd3a: I was a little confused on how to get the robot to understand what it was supposed to deliver, but it was easy enough to figure that out.

5c3d765288877: This was my first time doing something like this. I found it really interesting!

5c3d70383e7fa: Once it got past repeating questions about properties, or just asking for a yes or no, it was easy.

5c3d78dbee28d: The robot didn't know what marked was. It would be help to just say &quot;go to the spot marked&quot;

5c3dba79aa4f1: I didn't understand what it wanted. The instructions were very limited as to what to say for each action.

5c3d70e6b1eee: N/A

5c3d78941cfdf: Apparently I can type way faster than your interface can accept. I had to keep forcing myself to slow down.

5c3d71d5d8791: I found this cool and would have done more tasks/rounds of this.

5c3d76ed683c9: knowing the robot commands would have made the task much easier

5c3f8fe0a1c63: none

5c3f959804500: I think the task was a bit difficult to understand and could have been a little more in depth.

5c3f9483782f1: the robot needs to understand English better I believe to do its job, it needs to be programmed at a higher IQ. thanks for the work.

5c3fbadba640b: Fun task! Thank you!

5c3f978e82c0e: it is obvious that both parties must be sure to communicate clearly in a common way so that each can understand.

5c3fbea8c605c: Was a fun task outside what's normally on mturk. Felt a bit like an old school text adventure and really made me think about using specific words. Only complaint I have is how the typing would lag and skip letters if you typed too fast.

5c3f9b41a8eeb: I have no additional comments.

5c3f79bd6e9d1: I was not made aware of any objects to manipulate.

5c3f9689b7004: It kept saying something like &quot;you want me to move *this* from there on its way to there&quot; and I didn't understand what it meant.

5c3f96c289f49: The vocabulary of the robot needs to be widened for it to understand better and be of more use.

5c3f80ef537d9: At least the robot wasn't eaten by a grue.

5c3f7cf2061d3: very good

5c3f9eafd623c: The robot needs to understand possessives. The object was in Peggy's Office. But it only recognized office

5c3f79b10ac90: The robot was slightly frustrating because it was repeating the same question.

5c3f913186da3: it's easier when you've had programming experience and understand how much you need to lay things out for computers

5c3f7a47251e4: The button that takes me to this survey appears very slowly. I thought maybe the survey stopped working and I was about to contact you. Consider adjusting the time. Thank you.

5c3f7a3c14d61: I was confused about the robot not understanding words like &quot;place&quot; and &quot;it.&quot;

5c3f7fff8fa17: none

5c427e73d4163: the page seemed to lag

5c4274c6a6bb2: Looking back, I guess it would be helpful to state that the robot has limited language so be concise and use words for directions that it may recognize

5c42749835bec: Thank you, and have a nice day!

5c4276b72e553: You asked me to move the jar of peanuts to a room that was not an option. My X was in the printer room not an office on the floor plan.

5c42756b460f8: Very good

5c427813c1937: I understand it better now that I'm done!

5c42bc5fcb5ba: It was interesting.

5c427c7fdb4d7: It was a good survey.

5c42939c5662f: Was interesting. Kind of fun and neat.

5c42780a848a8: It was not easy to control the robot.

5c4275a855a6b: This seems like a ludicrous test of a technology that would have a very dim future.  It would require much more development to be viable even for testing in a genuine context.  As a brain teasing exercise, the uncertainties and apparent lack of motility or comprehension of the 'robot' challenge patience, though the time parameter was respectful, as initially indicated.

5c427bdd6d404: This is very confusing. Maybe its me but the position where the robot was at was no clear, I am not sure if you wanted to move it to there or from there. If is the former you don't even know where the robot is at. Then, the robot talks about an object. Its very confusing.

5c4278419bbb9: This was interesting and engaging. I would not have minded playing with the &quot;robot&quot; longer.

5c4278d270d7b: n/a

5c4276d36c2bf: This was a very neat exercise.

5c427c19f10c8: the robot didn't understand a lot of words.

5c42812389f22: The robot had no knowledge of the buildings

5c42a0b0a71bd: I was a little confused on how to start this task because of all the bolded text.
