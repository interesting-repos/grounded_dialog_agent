I'm still not certain why the robot was not able to go to the office named after Dave the first time I typed it in, but then chose to ask about it later after answering a question about the hallway. *shrug* Maybe I treated it too much like a robot? Like it forgot that I had asked him to go the office in the first place. I don't know.
