I admit I didn't understand the object or where the robot was located and I made an assumption about the object when I selected where on the floorplan to move the robot.  In its current state, I would not use the robot as it seems to have a lot of learning to do about translating human commands to movement but if that is worked out, I don't think I would have any problem using this robot to complete tasks for me like grabbing a printout from the printer across the office or delivering a note to a coworker
