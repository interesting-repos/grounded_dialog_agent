5c391ad082fef: The robot wasn't really the issue here for me - it was the directions I found confusing. I did not know if the robot already had the object, or first needed to be directed to fetch it. The table showing possible locations did not load right away, so I did not know to use it in order to direct the robot. Again, it's fairly simplistic once one knows what to do and the robot reacted just fine once I had the right information.

5c390e46e72df: The robot didn't understand enough commands.

5c38fe86af6a0: UNSURE ABOUT WHERE THE ROBOT WAS TO END UP. THOUGH HE UNDERSTOOD ME WELL, I DID NOT HAVE AN END TASK CLEARLY ILLUSTRATED TO ME.

5c3927014346c: A bit confused at first but soon I understood it. I am not sure it was the &quot;robots&quot; fault. I think my misunderstanding how to talk to the robot that was the problem.

5c38f94e67298: No

5c39238aa3eb2: Robot never moved.

5c3910616888b: no

5c390e9499c20: none

5c38f5b65665c: This would be a cool real thing

5c38f5b088cb1: Thanks for letting me participate.

5c3912348580f: This was fun!

5c38f8886392b: robot seemed to struggle with superlatives, but otherwise was easy to command in this particular case.

5c3908cb24857: I liked this task

5c3911fc29a40: I thought the way the robot could be commanded was awkward. Why not just accept simple directions instead of relying on keyword recognition?

5c38f809bf7f0: very good

5c38fd8553e38: Not enough information was given about the work area.  Were there hallways?  Why weren't the pods and labs given names or room numbers?  It was very confusing for somebody to just step in and do the task.

5c3ba53399b1a: Hope i directed him correctly :)

5c3c032f4b818: very nice survey

5c3bc23d5a720: The robot has a lot to learn. Also, it was not indicated where the robot is presently located.

5c3bdbd28247b: Actually it was very responsive and I only had to answer two question in order to complete the entire task!

5c3c039d80b4c: good

5c3bb4c67d8a7: The robot needed excessive guidance about whom to deliver the object.

5c3bd2ffd410a: It took me a minute to figure out exactly how to answer the questions from the robot but once I caught on it became easier.

5c3bad947e36e: The robot got too easily confused by answers that clearly answered its question. For example, I said &quot;Yes. Good job!&quot; and it did not understand until I simply said &quot;Yes.&quot; This made interacting with the robot time-consuming and feel artificial.

5c3ba1a2e1a0f: This robot needs help lol.

5c3bdb28e66dd: Difficult to specify location for delivery

5c3bd0f38fa99: Thank you

5c3bbda09de6f: I was unsure about the instructions - I thought we would be given a specific prompt to give the robot. I eventually figured it out, but that would have been helpful to know upfront!

5c3ba114d3ba7: The text that showed up onscreen sometimes seemed to lag behind what typed on the keyboard. Now and then key presses didn't register at all.

5c3ba1816eef0: A picture showed up and then went away.  Couldn't select picture.

5c3bbd97d4e2e: Page lagged a lot and kept making me misspell!

5c3ba1611da56: The robot understood where I wanted it to go within three questions. This entire process was very easy and I had little complications. The only issue I can think of is an input delay between typing and the letters appearing within the box.

5c3ba17086c53: I got completely confused and thought I was supposed to guide the robot to the red x. I was looking for where the robot was, but couldn't find him, so just gave instructions. If you wish to reject my efforts, so be it, but I really was trying!

5c3ba911b8ad0: COOL!!

5c3ba2200952f: At first the commanding is difficult, but it becomes easier after a little while.

5c3baeef078cf: Good luck with your studies!

5c3e726c3f343: The task was fairly easy to understand. However, an additional explanation should be given so we know not to tell the robot to pick up whatever is on the table.

5c3e48c7aadfa: It was a little confusing as to what i was supposed to be telling the robot to do.

5c3e60cf13506: It was a little difficult to instruct this robot to do what I wanted. the picture wasn't too obvious and it was hard to explain that to the robot.

5c3e53e3724d7: I  accidentally chose the wrong lab and I couldn't figure out how to go back and fix it.

5c3e3b404ad09: This application is EXTREMELY cumbersome to operate!!  I found it difficult to scroll the screen even before I started interacting with the robot.  It would just lock up.  Very, very frustrating!!!

5c3e615abf4e4: this is cool

5c3e52717e3a7: Thank you!

5c3e5ef1e6bae: interesting task

5c3e3b59bf43f: I was difficult to tell the robot without choosing from the pictures.

5c3e4c1f863f4: no

5c3e455f5e1eb: VERY GOOD STUDY

5c3e51039403b: I was going to give it one command at a time so I did't get the robot to do the whole command.

5c3e85550f528: I found this task interesting but I did not easily understand what I was supposed to do. I would suggest clarifying the instructions.

5c3e570d98a28: I wish the robot understood room names.

5c3e403e05fe3: The robot struggled to understand me because I used language that was not essential to the task.  I was unable to properly instruct it before I was able to select the image of the object.

5c3e3b2e2b3c3: It doesn't accept multiple command to get to the final destination

5c3e3ad81bad0: That was pretty cool

5c3e3c830452c: Fun study

5c3e4c19b413b: no

5c3e3ee02c5a7: Even I was confused.  What room were the chips in??

5c3ffa10bf225: Interesting task.

5c3ff9c7cfa7e: I just didn’t understand where I was suppose to tell him to go.

5c3ff6570ba81: robot needs larger vocabilary

5c401817efcbb: Change the language so it's easier to understand.

5c4019663bda9: There was no mention in the scenario of what I should tell the robot to do, so I attempted to make it go to an office. The robot seemed unable to recognize that a person's name was related to a location (e.g., &quot;Go to Bob Brown's office&quot; confused the robot)

5c4023c740372: Robot seemed to get confused by the complete sentences. It did not have a memory. I gave it the name of the recipient early on and it asked me who to deliver to later on.

5c3ffa004df30: As there were multiple lounges and pods, the robot seemed confused about where it should go. It was helpful that it popped up a map so that I could better select.

5c401556bffab: very nice

5c3ffd53399dd: At first I thought I would be giving directions from one room to another, but I finally figured out that I was just supposed to describe the location to the robot.

5c3ff8e86fcf1: The robot needed to move the item to the kitchen but &quot;Kitchen&quot; wasn't one of the choices and it wouldn't let me retype and retry &quot;Kitchen&quot; without choosing a person's office.

5c4020448b56f: n/a

5c40164561466: Good

5c401c021aa8f: i would use this if it was better understanding and learning

5c40173e05c26: N/A

5c3ffbd9e6a49: I was very confused about my part of this experiment here and wish there were more directions on the original command I was supposed to type. That would have made the experience in general much less frustrating.

5c3ffb8cde79a: There should be a way to clarify a comment freely.  I know it is necessary but the robot is rigid.

5c3ffa6585798: The robot did not understand disinfecting wipes, which was the object in the picture

5c3fffde51211: The robot was a fast responder which I appreciated but it couldn't recognize any of the things I was trying to move.

5c3ff9bb48eb3: I don't feel like I did a good job getting the robot to understand what I wanted him to do.

5c3ff9ad414c1: A list of more commands to give the robot would have made the experiment a lot easier.

5c3ff72d359f5: This was a very difficult task to get the robot to move to the desired location.

5c3ff7a42f901: It became evident that it was important to give literal and simple responses. It also became evident that the robot, when it did not understand verbal descriptions, searched its visual environment for objects or persons, which worked better under these circumstances.

5c3ffd80c4079: At first, I expected it to understand more than I should have. Overall, I enjoyed the survey and would love to work on more! I'm a huge fan of robotics &amp; AI. Keep up the great work!

5c401813927f1: interesting

5c56089931605: It would be easier if I tried it again. Takes a little practice.

5c560ff21c10e: N/A

5c5611c534750: I LIKE THIS SURVEY ,VERY NICE SUPER

5c5608c721a0e: Robot did not understand it was to deliver an object to the kitchen, rather than to a person.

5c5608a11cfba: I failed to scroll all the way down to the section where I could scroll through options. About two minutes passed until I realized this. If my input skills were sharper I would’ve found the task much easier.

5c5625550d8ac: That was hard!

5c5608ad42aef: It was really interesting!!

5c5629446b92f: NO COMMENTS

5c562e757414a: This was an interesting HIT. Thanks for the opportunity to participate!

5c562699b26af: It was unclear that movement and manipulation commands had to be entered separately.

5c5609997417d: I had a little trouble understanding the robot's wording, but it's OK.

5c564ce46c6ae: I was a bit confused about the task but I got the robot to walk to Office R

5c560ab52ac9c: This was a fun one compared haha thanks

5c56264b06ffe: The robot image showed the before and after at the printer location, which is incorrect. It didn't seem to understand to take the object to a new destination.

5c5608d80051a: the robot understood very well, i really was surprised.

5c5609641781c: I was unable to choose a empty/blank office to deliver item to.

5c5608b982e1e: If the robot encounters a word it does not understand, if it encounters that word again it should not keep asking what does it mean (in my opinion).  It should ask about that word only once.

5c560e7273640: Robots need to programmed so it can understands common human use command.

5c56093313773: If I were really using this robot I would expect more names to be established. Such as Lab 1, Lab 2, Lab 3, etc. I would expect to know common commands, such as move bring etc. Then I would feel confident to issue a command such as, &quot;move pringles from conference 1 to lab 2.&quot; It was strange that the robot told me it did not know the word &quot;is.&quot; I disagreed that I would use a robot like this. It is cool, but I just don't have a practical need for it.

5c561f61f0d0d: I didn't think it would literally try and find someone to deliver it to, although maybe I should have.
