5bfa25ac4d589: The robot asked weird things I can't really answer. Also, the things he replied were sometimes random.

5bfa22b7a7982: This is just a minor technical issue I noticed: Typing into the fields was very slow and was sometimes missing letters, a bit like the real time searching on some apps that goes letter by letter and is a bit slowed down that way. That made typing my communications a bit cumbersome.

5bfa231d6ff1f: Very interesting. Good luck!

5bfa5091e7ca7: Too many questions and misunderstandings. Also, I think the robot should have been more polite. It would have been less frustrating to deal with.

5bfa214565f57: I had trouble understanding if it could understand the office names or if I needed to use the letter associated with that office.

5bfa27fb0b338: No thank you

5bfa2ba849a3a: The instructions said speak in complete answers, but then the robot directed me (kind of rudely) to only give yes or no answers.
