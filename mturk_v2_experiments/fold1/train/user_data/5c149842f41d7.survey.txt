The robot didn't understand as many words as I thought it would initially! I expected it to understand more than just shapes and colors. However, in learning how to actually understand the English language entirely I totally understand how the robot wouldn't understand words like it and lid. This was super fun and very enlightening. Thank you for the opportunity!
