5bfcbd499d1c8: Thank you for allowing my participation!

5bfcd9be68877: While I find this very interesting, if I had to give that many commands to get something accomplished like moving a can of chips, I would just do it myself because I would spend more time redirecting and teaching than if I did it myself.  Now if this robot did  this quickly without much redirection then I would use it!

5bfccb37d8899: Interesting study

5bfca7af0ff70: the robot should know what the words item and object mean.

5bfca609743ff: You showed an object to be moved without telling me what kind of object it is and the robot was not smart enough to understand descriptions. Also, this task was especially frustrating because the text input boxes are very buggy. They can't keep up with a reasonable typing speed.

5bfca4a23f12c: I would use a robot like this to navigate but not if he is going to ask me a bunch of questions about items first; that might get a bit annoying.

5bfca805df951: I didn't realize my screen was big or zoomed in so I did not see the offices up at the right. It was my fault, not the robots. This was a fun task. wish I could do another one.

5bfca82f1bfbf: I couldn't figure out how to get it to the pod

5bfcc10de0e2a: I think I did not consider the complexity of my first instruction and should have just been simple.

5bfca5594b477: Was difficult to get the robot to understand much of anything.

5bfcb4542c602: Nice
