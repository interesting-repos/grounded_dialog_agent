Based on these and community concensus, seems reasonable to go with *look-resnet-color-fpfh* which achieves top
performance on ICRA SUB and barely less on AAAI PREDS. If we decide to pull in all behaviors, *all-b-resnet-color-fpfh*
is similarly basically equivalent for ICRA SUB and performs slihgtly better for AAAI PREDS.

In reality, the numbers in general are super small differences, and as soon as we introduce any ResNet layer, FC7 layer, or
all behaviors, performance jumps. Only using color and fpfh leads to weaker models, but adding any of the other three creates
something competitive with everything else, so we can choose the sensible thing for our story + current research climate.
