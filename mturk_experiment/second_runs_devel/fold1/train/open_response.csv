5a2e059c3e320: Robot did not understand what I wanted.

5a2e113268622: GOOD

5a2e05a10a130: The robot mentioned is smart. But simple command like &quot;go to office&quot; cannot be executed. If I say &quot;Office near to Mr. David&quot;, the robot is dumb and again asking what to do. May be the algorithm is required to be fine tuned.

5a2e0be7a4a75: froze after 1 task

5a2e0bb969273: good

5a2e0eec1d19b: All was fine.

5a2e05c9b4e51: In the third task the question wording was a little confusing.  I wanted the robot to take the item from one place and deliver it to another.  Otherwise, it was pretty fun!

5a2e0574769b7: The robot seemed to not understand a thing.

5a2e14ecd938c: IT WAS GOOD

5a2e1407c6dd6: it was good

5a2e057dd5daf: I received the message that the ROBOT may have encountered problems.  I am curious if I gave an incorrect response or command.  I would love to know.  Thank you

5a2e0bae694ef: Very interesting!

5a2e0830cf8b8: This was fun.

5a2e05ca67fe0: The last task did not work.  It did not present a task for me to command the robot to accomplish.  There was a blank space where it said a task should be written.  So it was frustrating to talk to the robot about objects and people without knowing what task could satisfy the objective of the exercise.

5a3091330a9d7: GOOD

5a3075a00623a: It would probably get easier to communicate with the computer because I would stat forming a consistent definition for words, like the computer's use of the word property I think I kept flip flopping on.

5a3075887799c: VERY DIFFERENT  EXPERIENCE

5a307607d6aa0: very good

5a3080ade62f7: GOOD

5a307559155ed: good

5a308875a19f3: Thanks for the opportunity

5a30826242812: GOOD

5a3077be09d74: Thanks, I liked robot # 3 the best. It grasped ideas faster than the first two robots!

5a307f2c5b8be: GOOD

5a30767fa875e: It was interesting, but I didn't always understand how to give commands or what the objective was.  I was a bit lost during the whole thing.

5a3078aea6906: good

5a307ff2a25e7: GOOD

5a30985a64ed4: NOTHING

5a30951f13152: good

5a3075c0be831: If you mistype something to the robot, there doesn't appear to be any way of stopping the robot from getting stuck in a loop.

5a30755edbc2c: Interesting study! Very cool work!

5a307b7e0dc63: good

5a30a1d0b1b91: I'm sorry I think I thoroughly confused your robot in the third task!

5a30b8ea97806: GOOD

5a30cee8dac6a: OMG I don't know about robots but I didn't like this one!  Enjoyed HIT though

5a30a1bc598ce: Interesting experiment.  I started to think this was about testing my patience.  :-)

5a30a17ff12de: VERY GOOD

5a30a8f317d28: GOOD

5a30a1dedcdff: This was a really interesting HIT, even if it was kind of frustrating at times. If you have any further ones for people who fully completed this, my ID is A366TZDVJK02PN

5a30ab01739e3: good survey

5a30a7f63a1a7: The directions were unclear about what the task was in the first task.

5a30a20ee5a2a: IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH A ROBOT. I REALLY HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH IT.

5a30a19b95da6: The robot does not seem to understand simple directionals such as left, right, up, down

5a30a5fdeaa35: thank you

5a30a1f7cd1e2: Very good

5a30b96eb06de: Very interesting!

5a30a71a12a93: THE ROBOT ITSELF IS CONFUSED IN MANY THINGS. HE DIDN'T UNDERSTANDS THE SIMPLE JOB IN SIMPLE LANGUAGES.

5a30ac038c418: nothing is good
