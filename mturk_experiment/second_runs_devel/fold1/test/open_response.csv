5a2eda839e14f: it was extremely frustrating

5a2edc7614133: Advised me that the robot experienced a problem

5a2ef62ca45f7: thank you

5a2ed92085754: NA

5a2ef02f07fdb: Needs retooling.

5a2eef54bf25a: Very interesting task!

5a2ee955063f6: Clear and concise, thank you. The robot is useful unless you need him to get something. Then he doesn't understand you.

5a2ed923e2957: Too long. Should pay $1.50, at least. More for the frustration. Respect workers' time.

5a2ed928c4f64: That was interesting but rather annoying. The robot needs more intelligence and education.

5a2eea7515adb: Very unfair pay and very unfair practices as a requester. YOu didnt even bother to give workers an idea on how long this hit would take, nor was there a consent page prior to beginning!!!!!!!!!!!!

5a2eda68a6476: The robot asked too many unnecessary questions and didn't respond to my instructions clearly.

5a2f00de73e22: nice

5a2ee9d9204b8: No comments

5a2eeb1e5de71: This was a cool survey. I hope there are more to come! Thank you

5a2edad00333e: could not communicate. seems we should have come much further by now- it was like a program I used when I was a kid maybe back in 1975..

5a2edf08d7b43: I couldn't get him to identify the white container with a red lid. He kept asking me if the same objects were what I wanted him to deliver so I ended it.

5a2efa5336161: its nice

5a2ef53c76c1d: The robot needed way too much hand-holding.

5a2ef81857c48: good

5a2f1e5a04cc7: The first few instances did not actually tell the survey taker what they were supposed to do with the robot.

5a2f32fe9c5b5: good

5a2f2e1b9d296: good

5a2f1e208a3ec: good

5a2f3a29698a9: good survey

5a2f1fa493c2c: GOOD

5a2f1c3ab9450: I liked the experience, but it was frustrating because the robot wasn't understanding what I was trying to say to it.

5a2f20b7bedf2: I am disappointed that the robot crashed so early. I love trying to parse out how to get the robot to accomplish tasks. It's a highlight of my day. ^^ Thank you.

5a2f2d7b8c162: none thanks

5a2f1e70a992a: nice

5a2f1d1b8926b: The multiple questions the robot would ask about both person and object could mislead the bot as one of the answers may be correct and the other wrong

5a2f1c3071b16: that was very paitent ful survey

5a2f1c495d775: The robot has a lot of learning to do but hopefully it will continue to improve over time

5a3043a344ce0: Bad Robot

5a3066d796616: good

5a304d978a0f7: The robot hardly ever listened to anything I told it. It came up with it's own questions about things I never said. It was impossible to get it to move the items I wanted it to or to get it to go where I wanted it to go. I had to give up, it was taking way too long for 1 dollar.

5a30456858f08: nice

5a3045a10390c: nice

5a3049f2c73c1: VERY EASY

5a304e1e28ac8: I couldn't explain what a cap was.

5a3065d4ea51b: Thank you! It's great to feel like I'm making progress in understanding how the robot parses information.

5a304fbec6c6f: Broke on task #3, never even got to engage

5a3063fc37788: yes

5a305165ae128: nice.. thanks...
