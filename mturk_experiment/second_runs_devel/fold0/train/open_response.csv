5a2b2d60deb0b: Thank you. Always fun. ^^

5a2b47b947e0e: Infuriating! But I was keen to figure out how to properly communicate with the robot. The first was easy, the second I finally figured it out with the right words, but the third felt impossible!! Nice job!

5a2b2c7f852bb: I thought this was fun, and very interesting.

5a2b91b6ce988: good

5a2b486ce1f53: GOOD

5a2b334ea9f70: These HITs are kind of just awful. The game responds randomly, entering a random string of characters or a single character provides the same results as attempting to interact with the game with meaningful responses.

5a2b2bf705b56: this robot needs to learn concepts like size, location terms, direction before completing these tasks. Also, we need to know which way the robot is oriented to help give directions

5a2b2bcfcade8: It was hard trying to get the robot to understand what object you wanted it to deliver to a specific person.

5a2b44958b865: Very interesting. Unfortunately bot became confused and shutdown. Would love to participate in these again!

5a2b6666c02e2: Thanks!

5a2b4aabcaa78: I don't know who's dumber, the robot or the guys who designed its UI.  Tasks were easy to understand, but if natural language processing isn't up to speed just have a map interface.

5a2b4a161c4a2: the robot kept asking, Where should I move something from on its way somewhere else? and I couldn't make heads or tails of the question

5a2b3a06d8684: Great! Thanks for the opportunity

5a2b2d885cfd5: This was ridiculous.

5a2b4fd45b6e5: The robot kept repeating the question of specifying what item I wanted delivered or what location I wanted it to go to, even after I had answered the exact same question previously multiple times.

5a2b682f4e7b2: In the last task, the robot chose everything except what I wanted i to chose.

5a2c26b26d299: Can feed in some more commands

5a2c25d55ab41: very good to do.

5a2c432a4340a: I needs a lot more training, but heading in the right direction.

5a2c31533b624: the robot freezed at the second task.

5a2c2ddcf18e4: I am not sure I succeeded in the last task.

5a2c48f15abe6: The robot did not seem to understand what I was telling it to do.  Also, the task wasn't entirely clear.  I didn't know what to tell the robot.  No instructions were given regarding that.  You simply stated, give the robot commands in complete sentences but did not state my overall object, such as go from this room to this room.

5a2c2b74b6ae0: The instructions were a bit confusing.

5a2c25a75be4b: The UI of this survey was frustrating. Make it a bit more user-friendly, because I think participants' survey responses will be colored by the frustration of the interface and HTML coding.

5a2c25c198bec: Without a list of commands you are just shooting in the dark.

5a2c27aaab139: Took too long with too much frustration.

5a2c259a95191: fun and interesting task, i liked experimenting with the bot.

5a2c293d7becf: Work

5a2c43c2aff38: This survey should have paid three times what it did due to the time and work involved. Please be respectful of MTurkers and pay a decent wage in the future. Thanks and have a nice day.

5a2c38de8ad80: This was very confusing.

5a2c818feef4d: Seems like the robot is getting dumber each time I use it

5a2c5a7b98879: This was interesting. The robot still needs to learn basic colors, as well as the names of various types of containers (including names/labels that can sometimes be interchangeable, such as &quot;can&quot; and &quot;cylinder&quot;).

5a2c5b6484557: there should be rooms that are not called the same thing like the pod room.  there is nothing in there to tell robot how to find it.

5a2c5a84d4930: It was difficult to find the words the robot knew.

5a2c5afd6a0e9: good task

5a2c5b8d91405: N/A

5a2c81298e3c3: very good to do this servey

5a2c600eee649: N/A

5a2c5abc1d834: The last task was almost impossible.  The robot didn't understand anything I told it to do.
