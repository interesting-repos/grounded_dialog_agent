5a2c94357131d: Thank you for allowing me to participate in this research.

5a2cbc75bff66: Thanks for the opportunity

5a2cb342e1202: The process (loading part)can be made fast.

5a2c9a833efc5: Good Task.

5a2c94afb09b3: Its a good experience to chat with Robot. As the instructions mentioned that the Robot can understand all commands, I had some difficulty first. However, after that I understood how to give instructions. Its interesting to do this task.

5a2c955023dc6: This was a very frustrating experience and I would recommend that you go back to the drawing board in designing this robot.

5a2c937ad0eb0: in frustration i told the robot yes to incorrect things.

5a2c93c284783: It was difficult to make the robot understand adjectives like colors, sizes.. etc. It was a fun task though

5a2c93f83ded5: A simple list of syntax would help greatly. Also an example of the robot's capabilities. If the goal is to have me move an object to a conference room, I'd need to know how to make it understand what that is and where it is.

5a2c95076838b: Extremely frustrating

5a2cb3539f72c: The robot told me he didn't understand words I used, then turned around and used the words he claimed he didn't know.

5a2c94ab32f5e: A lot of the pictures of objects were taken from a perspective that made them difficult to identify.

5a2c948ecbef2: The robot did well up until the last task. I think it thought that white and clear meant the same thing. So I could not get it to pick the correct object. It was like talking to baby groot from gaurdians of the galaxy.

5a2c93e2ee32d: It was interesting.  It took me a bit to figure out how to talk to the robot.  (Still not a pro!)

5a2c9cd81b3be: We had the locations down in the last one! We just needed to get the object! Then it kept asking about the locations again and getting them wrong!

5a2c93ba3863f: Why would the robot repeatedly ask if I wanted him to go to the same place. That seems like a pretty basic thing to program into him: once you are told no stop asking the same question

5a2ce0078f3da: It was kind of fun.  a lot like a game

5a2ce4688b7bb: Nice one.

5a2cfefc2f7d0: good work

5a2cdf3b99ed7: Interesting one.

5a2ce2c14e5ab: i think using color coded shapes would be a better starting point rather than using random objects

5a2ce03c7440d: Why does the robot not understand the word Pod? Or people's names? Come on robot, you can figure this out! You're smarter than this!

5a2ce1f39929e: This was the most interesting task I've ever completed. I think the technology you're developing is fascinating. Thank you for putting this together.

5a2ce31ec711e: For some reason when typing some keystrokes would not register so you ended up with wrong words or letters. I think that locked me into the wrong person when asking it to get the object for Peggy.

5a2d003c5cae6: Horrible, different and difficult to handle the robot

5a2ce10a8d2df: Nice.

5a2ce070b3b9e: Its a good experience. But, in the third task I struggled much as it seems like a pattern is repeating regardless of what instructions are given to follow.

5a2ce90331fb9: I like this.

5a2cdfc0e43ec: task was little confusing and tedious....

5a2ce3d3980e9: good surevy

5a2d89e754dc7: i am little bit confused to do this task but at the end i understand..good to command robot

5a2d8b0bd6b90: GOOD SURVEY

5a2d8c5d93ea4: the interface for typing commands seems to not completely register all my keystrokes

5a2d8a015dd00: NICE STUDY EVER I SEEN, I THINK I CLEARLY CHAT WITH ROBOT AND FIND HIS TASK SUCCESSFULLY, THANK YOU...PLEASE I SPENT MORE TIME TO COMPLETE THIS SO PLEASE PROVIDE SOME BONUS FOR THIS.

5a2d8d361aa9e: I enjoy the robot problems. I find them to be the most fun as I get to learn and maybe teach, I don't know for certain, at the same time. This AI appears to be just learning or it got stuck with me and I'm maybe not good at this. But I enjoy the challenge and really do like working with the robots.

5a2d99396fc4e: I would have to say that this robot wasn't programmed very well.  It should be re-programmed and updated before it's put to use.  Nonetheless, this was still a fun task.  Thanks for posting it online.  And good luck in your research!

5a2d9f0a50726: This is among the worst AIs I've ever seen.

5a2db2cb0ddd3: I messed up the first one, sorry! Made up for it in the last, though.
