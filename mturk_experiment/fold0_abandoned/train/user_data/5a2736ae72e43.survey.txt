The task crashed several times and I had to restart the entire task each time. The final trial of the task I was able to complete took too long, the robot asked &quot;Is this the object&quot; Yes/No questions forever. I received a message instructing me I could skip to the survey, but chose to stick it out. This was a mistake, it was a huge waste of time.
