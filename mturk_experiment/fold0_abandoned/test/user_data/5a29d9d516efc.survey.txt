WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WASTE MY TIME like that?   15 NO's and no way to redirect the robot? It says to give it high level instructions, but doesn't understand words like middle or building...  when there are 3 pods with nothing to distinguish them, how am I supposed to instruct the robot? I am using every fibre of my being not to curse at you and tank the TO on this HIT.  I think it is programmed that way to reduce the amount of bonus you give out. Too bad
