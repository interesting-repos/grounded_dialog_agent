I had no way of knowing what to call the pills, and the robot couldn't find them. It might be helpful to give a set of item descriptions the robot might understand, also I had no idea how to tell him to go to the empty office next to David &quot;Dave&quot; Daniel room, and how to specifically describe the specific lab he needed to deliver the pills too. Overall, I found commanding the robot to be a bit confusing without a set of more concrete instructions.
