After the first task, the robot encountered some problem and I was asked t proceed to the survey. The first task was interesting and the fact that the robot understood my instructions with just high level instruction is quite good. I believe the robot already knows all the rooms and their relative positions without which it would have been difficult to accomplish the task.
