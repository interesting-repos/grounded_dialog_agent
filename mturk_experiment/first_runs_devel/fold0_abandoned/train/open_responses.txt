5a274b261e21d: good

5a2736ae72e43: The task crashed several times and I had to restart the entire task each time. The final trial of the task I was able to complete took too long, the robot asked &quot;Is this the object&quot; Yes/No questions forever. I received a message instructing me I could skip to the survey, but chose to stick it out. This was a mistake, it was a huge waste of time.

5a272e558b351: The robot acts like a 3-year old kid with all of the questions.  :-)

5a2763ea059f4: For the first task, the problem the robot was supposed to solve was not specified. For the third task, I think the item was supposed to be delivered to the Conference Room, but I couldn't get the robot to understand that.

5a27323119b98: I found this incredibly frustrating.  The robot didn't understand words like end, large, shape, size or the other offices in the map.  Not sure if that was the point, but I feel bad we didn't get to the right answer.

5a272eb16b247: This was ... fun? I guess?

5a272e43166d0: Frustrating

5a272fb86a99a: Doesn't work well

5a27350a9e3c8: I couldn't get him to do the third task! He kept asking where I wanted him to go, but he didn't understand &quot;go get&quot; something.

5a272e29c0259: I gave up on the second task because I couldn't identify the object myself. I could see that it was a white canister with a red top, but I couldn't tell what was in it. So once I realized the robot knew NO color words, I gave up. Also, it got sidetracked on the definition of &quot;maroon&quot;. I thought it would at least know the names of the people it worked with.

5a27405670d46: Robot really had a difficult time understanding the second task. Overall, not too bad

5a273293e2ff3: It was a lot of fun. I think if you were a little more explicit in telling me what you wanted me to have the robot do it would be helpful.

5a2750a7251d6: THAT WAS SO ANNOYING

5a260f71c6ab2: NICE

5a260ad36e717: GOOD

5a261d3663ec6: SUPER I HAVE VERY INTEREST THE CHATING MESSAGE

5a261e8bbc5bd: Thanks for the opportunity

5a260c2a357d2: good and very nice

5a26148dc85df: I thought we were doing so well, until the last portion i completed... i think i was just as lost or confused as the robot was. Im not real sure where i went wrong in my communication to the robot.

5a2620c101729: GOOD

5a26021420ced: This was refreshing but frustrating. Thank you!

5a261e1d875fd: the robot cant understand my words

5a2601efc1d38: This robot is terrible. It doesn't understand sentances at all. It asks questions about words that have nothing to do with the discussion. It is impossible to discribe anything to it.

5a26022ae4b08: The first task was a learning curve for me as well.  I do think I got the hang of it and even though the robot was frustrating it was a fun task to work on.  Thanks.

5a261e8b17915: ROBOT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND ME.

5a2601d2720e6: Wow I really had a great time on this experience. I sort of got stuck at the end. The robot had the wrong object in mind and wasn't sure how to get him back on track. Thanks for the opportunity

5a26020a1de03: This was fun

5a260531ec754: NOTHING

5a260ca5c1150: Nothing worked on this. I could not type into the box

5a26032273ee5: good

5a2602019be46: It would be quicker to know just deliver the item rather than use this robot

5a2610e438a6a: NOTHING

5a26037a8d02f: I couldn't complete the last task successfully, and that made me a little sad.

5a260efa0d546: GOOD

5a26375591516: good

5a261f31c76b0: NOTHING

5a261e9abae9a: this survey is to be good and nice

5a26108641464: NOTHING

5a261d4fe8bad: I wish I could have done more, but I couldn't figure out how to make the robot understand me.

5a2601e513c7b: I'd be happy to do the rest of the trials if you need them to be completed.

5a260207282bb: Neat exercise. Let's cut to the chase, the second task was never going to come to fruition, was it? Like Zandar, kids just keep pumping quarters into the machine but they never get to the next level?

5a260531ec754: NOTHING

5a2621b95c360: NOTHING

5a2487fe6250a: The robot never spoke. I wanted until I was prompted to proceed to the survey.

5a2485ed24318: The instructions were not particularly clear which lead to confusion about how to best guide the robot.  I felt that with a better understanding of what my objective was I could have better instructed the robot.

5a24861a94787: I really like this activity. It said that the robot was experiencing problems and asked me to advance to the survey.

5a2485de82f64: I am considerably less worried about robots taking our jobs than I was before attempting this survey.

5a24863b6ff83: The robot never loaded a question for me! This is the message that popped up after 5 minutes of waiting.

5a2501f26b151: The robot encoutered a problem and I was instructed to advance.

5a249ab2f1613: There was no way to give the robot a command!!

5a2485b0f341f: I would definitely rather get up and do whatever it was I was trying to get the robot to do, myself. LOL

5a24884c713ac: The instructions were confusing because it said to give the robot complex sentences, but then the robot only wanted yes or no answers to everything after that point. And some of its questions did not make sense so answering yes or no didn't really apply. Cool though! Just needs lots of work.

5a249978743fa: Really wish the task and robot program worked, was looking forward to trying to direct the robot to the X. Waited for almost 20 min with nothing happening...

5a2485e834034: I did not quite understand how to work command for the robot to understand

5a248bf3cb021: Sorry we did not get very far.  I tried my hardest to get the robot to do what I asked, but had no real luck...

5a24891da1093: The first task was a little obscure it doesn't say what you should get the robot to do it just says &quot;robot should be here&quot;

5a24892f711a6: The robot did not respond to me.

5a2485c5be066: It's not clear exactly what language we're supposed to use - the robot didn't understand me most of the time. Also, it took me awhile to understand exactly what the task was.

5a25067b9a1fa: The robot did not respond.  I tried refreshing the page a few times but I could not get the task started.

5a252c9bb6163: The Robot did not seem to load or finish thinking.

5a24df810d656: I was extremely excited to get a chance at this hit. Unfortunately I waited for over 15 minutes staring at a blank screen with the robot &quot;thinking&quot;, and then it &quot;encountered a problem&quot;. I never even got to type a command. I really enjoy these tasks that involve robotics and I'm very disappointed this one didn't work out for me. I would very much like to try again in the future, though. Please email me if you would like - paopaoky1@gmail.com

5a248605bb702: sorry i could not accomplish the second task

5a24932a9775b: Robot encountered a problem and would not start

5a2486ce1f068: The robot never asked me any questions. It said robot was experiencing a difficulty and I could go to survey and end task.
