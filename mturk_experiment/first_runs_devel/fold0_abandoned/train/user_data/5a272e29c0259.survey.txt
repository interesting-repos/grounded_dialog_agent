I gave up on the second task because I couldn't identify the object myself. I could see that it was a white canister with a red top, but I couldn't tell what was in it. So once I realized the robot knew NO color words, I gave up. Also, it got sidetracked on the definition of &quot;maroon&quot;. I thought it would at least know the names of the people it worked with.
