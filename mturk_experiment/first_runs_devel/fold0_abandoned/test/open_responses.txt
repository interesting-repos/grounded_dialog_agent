5a29ed650c379: GOOD

5a29df4a5dd21: The robot didnâ€™t understand the names.

5a29d9c7c0cb7: It was definitely a unique experience. Are you planning on using him as a little snack runner?

5a29e830e6b81: ITS A NEW AND LEARNING EXPERIENCE ... THANK YOU SO MUCH ....

5a29da2f1bf51: I believe the third lab was set up so it's impossible to complete and as such the double bonus was a scam.

5a2a1a72d8603: That last one was tough!

5a29fbfa43173: good

5a29f65717887: good

5a29fe511eab8: none

5a29e390ac534: I am sad. The robot crashed. This seemed like a great task! Thank you. :)

5a29edcb4bb16: Aggravating

5a29da5f184f4: These robot control tasks are way too long, the text input control is frustrating, and the robot doesn't advance to the proper stage and ends up in a loop. Even if the bonus is paid out, these tasks pay far too little for the time invested.

5a29d9b96aa6f: That was fun even though I think I failed on every task. I would have liked the chance to get the robot to continue the task once he moved to the first location.

5a29efcabe6da: I think it repeated questions that I'd already answered no to

5a29d9d516efc: WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WASTE MY TIME like that?   15 NO's and no way to redirect the robot? It says to give it high level instructions, but doesn't understand words like middle or building...  when there are 3 pods with nothing to distinguish them, how am I supposed to instruct the robot? I am using every fibre of my being not to curse at you and tank the TO on this HIT.  I think it is programmed that way to reduce the amount of bonus you give out. Too bad

5a29da11abb81: GOOD

5a25cf3ecfef3: yes this is best of one

5a25d56a03863: thank you

5a25cc15905ee: your robot needs help

5a25cc33a9d48: It was little frustrating as the robot was not exactly doing what I am asking him to perform and going on repeating the same thing again and again.

5a25cc1452c46: One of the map images didn't fully load on the last task. So I couldn't see where the robot was moving the soda can.

5a25d5fe4e199: that is nice and good experience

5a25cc0a9b2c8: I felt really confused most of the time.

5a25cc48e2114: I could not finish the last task. The robot did not understand my commands so I had to break it into parts, and after the first part I was unable to continue talking to the robot.

5a25e20c636da: My robot froze, so I wasn't able to do anything.

5a25d90f5d9c1: its easy

5a25d64c0ce73: it so nice for survey....

5a25ddd3c3184: very good

5a25cdc8b9e80: I have never been so triggered by something so stupid in my entire life.

5a25d8a1df718: nice

5a25cd05a4bfa: The question that the robot asked weren't always clear. &quot;do you want me to walk somewhere&quot; in a task with multiple requests shouldn't trigger the end of the task if answered yes.

5a25d8bb1ecd3: thank u

5a25cc1c5e514: This robot seems to know nothing.  I said tall white column.  After some questions about what tall was, it proceeded to show me round orange balls and squat red cans.

5a25ce339b42d: The last task was frustrating. I thought if I got the robot to go to the room where the object was that at least we could make some progress on getting the object, but it just went there and stopped.

5a25d5c3a8733: VERY DIFFICULTY SURVEY AND COMMENTS I ABOUT HERE

5a25e9f6ba415: I was told by a prompt to advance to this page since the robot encountered a problem. I didn't get to test the robot at all. It was stuck on start up. From reading the instruction the task seemed reasonable and I understood what to do. If things went more smoothly I was moderately confident that I could finish the tasks successfully.

5a258b35a9185: Biggest frustration was asking unrelated questions and asking questions one by one instead of being able to pick from many pictures

5a25998b2ed5a: I had to reload the page several times because the robot was taking way too long to think and tell me where it wanted to go. In the end, it still did not want to respond.

5a258b3f7a001: The robot didn't seem to understand basic things like names, which was really frustrating.

5a259f5f43a5d: thanks

5a2597fae9df3: Yes! This was a very frustrating task! But it was challenging!

5a258c4104f11: In starting I couldn't understand how to convince or tell the robot where to go because it wasn't understanding names clearly, then in the second task, I did great but then in the last task, I wasn't clear enough to make the robot follow my directions.

5a2598bd692a3: It was cool but frustrating when the robot couldn't understand what I wanted him to do.

5a258c0873a49: The instructions were very unclear in the first task as to what the robot was supposed to do, and I did not feel that any of the tasks were completed satisfactorily.

5a259bdd93b50: I was advanced to this screen because my robot did nor seem to function properly.

5a259ba246460: The robot never loaded :(

5a25937a78be1: The robot didn't understand
